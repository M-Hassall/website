    <h1>Wildlife Conservation</h1>
    <p>Wildlife conservation is the preservation and protection of animals, plants and their habitats. By conserving
        wildlife we are making sure that future generations will be able to enjoy the natural world
        and all of the incredible species that live within it. To help protect wildlife it is important to understand
        how species interact within their eco sysytems and how they are affected by environmental
        and human influences.

        Conservation goals include:
    <ul>
        <li>Conserving Habitats</li>
        <li>Preventing Deforestation</li>
        <li>Slowing and Stopping the extinction of species</li>
        <li>Reduce Overfishing</li>
        <li>Marine Pollution</li>
        <li>Reduce the effects of Climate Change</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to highlight the need to protect the earth in its entirety from the top of
            mount
            everest to the bottom of the ocean and everything inbetween.
            The definition of Conservation is the act of trying to protect of preserve something or the limiting of how
            much
            of any given resource that you use, the importance of conservation should not be underestimated,
            As the act of Conservation ensures that future generations can enjoy the natural world in all its beauty and
            the
            incredible wildlife that call it home.

            <p>The human population has grown exponentially over the past 200 years, to over 7 billion people, this
                means that more natural resources are being used and being used faster.
                This growth in population also means that people need more space to live often endangering the animals
                and the habitats in which they live, especially the plants and animals that may be dislaced so that
                people can use the land for farming or other develpoments.Other threats include the introduction of
                invasive species which can be devastating to the species already in that area.
