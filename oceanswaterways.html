    <h1>Water Pollution</h1>
    <p>Water is ensential to life, All organism's contain it, drink it or live in it, Plants and animals require
        relativly pure water if the water contains toxic chemicals or harmful micro-organisms it could be deadly.
        Water Pollution kills large quantity of fish, birds and other animals in some cases killing everything in an
        affected area.The major water pollutants are chemical, biological, and physical materials that lessen the water
        quality. Water pollution can be separated into several different catagories:</p>

    <p>Groundwater: When rain falls andseeps deep into the earth, filling the cracks and crevices and porous spaces of
        an aquifer it becomes Groundwater, one of the leaast visable but most important natural resources. Groundwater
        gets contaminated when pollutants from pesticides and fertilizers to waste leeched from landfills and septic
        tanks make their way into an aquifer rendering it unsafe for human use. Once polluted, an aquifer may be
        unusable for decades or even thousands of years. Groundwater can also spread contamination far from the
        origional pollution source as it gets into streams and lakes and oceans.</p>
    <p>Surface water : When toxic substances enter lakes, streams and rivers they get dissolved or lie suspended in the
        water. This results in the pollution of the water when this happens the quality of the water deteriorates,
        affecting aquatic eco systems. Sewage from cities and industrial waste are the most common sources of
        pollutants. Agricultural run-off that drains from fields into rivers is another major pollutanst as it contains
        herbicies and pesticides. This water which ultimately ends up in our households is often highly contaminated and
        carries disease causing microbes. </p>
    <p>Ocean water: 80% of ocean pollution originates on land wheter along the coast line or further inland.
        Contaminates such as chemicals, fertilizers, heavy metals and plastics are carried from farms and factories and
        cities by streams and rivers into bays and estuaries and from there into the ocean. the ocean absorbs as much as
        a quarter of man made emissions. </p>
