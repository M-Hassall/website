    <h1>Climate Change</h1>
    <p>Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers
        and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.</p>
    <p> Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occuring: loss
        of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer more intense heat waves. Scientists have high cinfidence that
        global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gasses produced by
        human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), which includes more than 1300 scientists
        from all over the world forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10°F in the next century.
        The IPCC predicts that increases in in global mean temperature of less than 1.8 to 5.4°F (1 to 3°C) above 1990
        levels will produce beneficial impacts in some regions and harmful ones in others.
        net annual costs will increase over time as global temperatures increase. </p>
    <p>"Taken as a whole" the IPCC states, "The range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of
        climate change are likely to be significant and increase over time."</p>
    <p>Global warming is likely to be the greatest cause of species extinctions this century. The IPCC says a 1.5°C
        average rise may put 20-30% of species at risk of extinction. If the planet warms by more than 2°C, most
        ecosystems will struggle. Many of the world's threatend species live in areas that will be severly affected by
        climate change. And Climate change is happening too quickly for many species to adapt.

    <p>Melting Arctic ice removes hunting ground from polar bears. Warmer water temperatures will cause population
        declines for trout, salmon, and many other species that require cold water to survive. Rising ocean temperatures
        have already caused massive coral bleaching, leading to the collapse of these ecosystems, which sustain huge
        numbers of fish.

        Many species take their cues about when to migrate, flower, nest, or mate from seasonal changes in temperature,
        precipitation, and daylight. Climate change is confusing those signals and forcing wildlife to alter their life
        cycle and seasonal events. In the western United States, warming and drought stress are causing trees to die and
        making them more vulnerable to pine beetle and other insect infestations. Higher temperatures and increased fuel
        from dead trees have led to more wildfires.
    </p>
    <p>Climate change also affects animals and plants as the world experiences further changes in rainfall and
        temperature.Forecasts show that 30 per cent of land-based bird species could become extinct if temperatures
        continue to
        rise. Climate change will also have a negative impact on plants, insect species and on parts of the world's
        rainforests.Some butterflies, foxes, and alpine plants have migrated to colder climates or to higher, cooler
        areas.
        Spruce bark beetles have boomed in Alaska thanks to 20 years of warm summers. The insects have chewed up 4
        million acres of spruce trees.
    </p>
    <p>Ecosystems will change, for example some species will move farther north or become more successful; others won’t
        be able to move and could become extinct.Wildlife researchers have found that since the mid-1980s, with less ice
        on which to live and less fish for food,polar bears have become considerably skinnier. They fear that if sea ice
        disappears, polar bears could become extinct in the wild.
    </p>
    <p>Researchers have tracked the decline of the Adélie penguins in Antarctica, where their numbers have fallen from
        32,000 breeding pairs to 11,000 in 30 years.Species that depend on one another may become out of sync. For
        example, plants could bloom earlier than their pollinating insects become active.</p>
