    <h1>Climate Change</h1>
    <p>Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers
        and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.</p>
    <p> Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occuring: loss
        of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer more intense heat waves. Scientists have high cinfidence that
        global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gasses produced by
        human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), which includes more than 1300 scientists
        from all over the world forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10°F in the next century.
        The IPCC predicts that increases in in global mean temperature of less than 1.8 to 5.4°F (1 to 3°C) above 1990
        levels will produce beneficial impacts in some regions and harmful ones in others.
        net annual costs will increase over time as global temperatures increase. </p>
    <p>"Taken as a whole" the IPCC states, "The range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of
        climate change are likely to be significant and increase over time."[6] </p>
    <p>Global warming is likely to be the greatest cause of species extinctions this century. The IPCC says a 1.5°C
        average rise may put 20-30% of species at risk of extinction. If the planet warms by more than 2°C, most
        ecosystems will struggle. Many of the world's threatend species live in areas that will be severly affected by
        climate change. And Climate change is happening too quickly for many species to adapt.
