    <h1>Habitat Conservation</h1>
    <p>Habitat Conservation is the practice of protecting a habitat in order to protect the species living within
        it. Habitat destruction decreases the number of places wildlife can live. Habitat fragmentation breaks up a
        continuous tract of habitat,often dividing large wildlife populations into several smaller ones [2].
        Human caused habitat loss and fragmentation are primary drivers of species declines and extinctions. Key
        examples of human induced habitat loss include :
    <ul>
        <li>Deforestation</li>
        <li>Agricultural expansion</li>
        <li>Urbanization</li>
    </ul>
    Habitat destruction and fragmentation can increase the vulnerability of wildlife populations by reducing the space
    and resources available to them and increasing the chances of conflict with humans, Moreover, destruction
    and habitat fragmentation create smaller habitats. Smaller habitats support smaller populations and smaller
    populations are more likely to go extinct.[3]

    <p>Protecting a habitat can sometimes be preferable to focusing on a single species, especially if the animal lives
        with other endangered animals or has very specific requirements for their habitats.
        Bio-diversity hopspots are a prime example of this with exceptionally high levels of species found no where else
        in the world, these areas are mainly tropical rainforests like the Amazon rainforest.
        Habitat conservation is usually carried out by creating protected areas like nature reserves and national parks.
