    <h1>Habitat Conservation</h1>
    <p>Habitat Conservation is the practice of protecting a habitat in order to protect the species living within
        it. Habitat destruction decreases the number of places wildlife can live. Habitat fragmentation breaks up a
        continuous tract of habitat,often dividing large wildlife populations into several smaller ones .
        Human caused habitat loss and fragmentation are primary drivers of species declines and extinctions. Key
        examples of human induced habitat loss include :
    <ul>
        <li>Deforestation</li>
        <li>Agricultural expansion</li>
        <li>Urbanization</li>
    </ul>
    Habitat destruction and fragmentation can increase the vulnerability of wildlife populations by reducing the space
    and resources available to them and increasing the chances of conflict with humans, Moreover, destruction
    and habitat fragmentation create smaller habitats. Smaller habitats support smaller populations and smaller
    populations are more likely to go extinct.[3]

    <p>Protecting a habitat can sometimes be preferable to focusing on a single species, especially if the animal lives
        with other endangered animals or has very specific requirements for their habitats.
        Bio-diversity hopspots are a prime example of this with exceptionally high levels of species found no where else
        in the world, these areas are mainly tropical rainforests like the Amazon rainforest.
        Habitat conservation is usually carried out by creating protected areas like nature reserves and national parks.
        Habitat loss and destruction can occur becasue of natural climate change these events have been the cause of
        many widespread and large scale losses in habitats, however these events are mass extinction events such as
        earth entering an ice age or the warming of the planet that followed. The human impact on habitat loss however
        has been prolonged and devastating. One examle of this is the 200,000 acres of rainforest that is burned every
        day. That is more than 150 acres lost every minute of every day and 78 million acres every year. More than 20
        percet of the Amazon rainforest is already gone and much more is severely threatened as the destruction
        continues.
    </p>
    <p>More than half of the planets estimated 10 million animals, plants and insects call tropical rainforests home and
        one-fifth of the worlds fresh water is in the amazon basin.Around 80% of the devolped worlds diet originates
        from tropical rainforests.
